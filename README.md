MATHME - Hackathon Project

Project Overview: MATHME is an AI-powered tool developed in a 24-hour hackathon to support teachers and students in tackling complex math problems. MATHME streamlines the learning process by providing real-time feedback and targeted assistance, enabling teachers to improve their instruction and helping students learn more effectively.

How It Works:

    Teacher Setup: The teacher enters a challenging math problem and provides a detailed step-by-step solution. This solution is sent to the AI.
    Student Interaction: The AI delivers the problem to students, who then work through each step. They submit an image of their work at each step.
    AI Feedback: The AI checks each student's answer step-by-step. If there's an error:
        The student receives a hint to retry.
        If the student struggles again, the AI sends a YouTube video tutorial for that specific step.
    Progress Tracking: For every step, the AI tracks the number of attempts taken by each student, recording progress and difficulty.
    Teacher Insights: After the exercise, MATHME provides the teacher with data on average attempts and highlights steps that were challenging for most students, enabling them to refine their teaching approach.

Key Features:

    Real-time AI Feedback: Provides hints and resources based on individual student needs.
    Adaptive Learning: Offers video explanations for additional support.
    Teacher Dashboard: Aggregates data on student performance, showing common problem areas for instructional improvement.

MATHME empowers teachers with insights to tailor future lessons and helps students develop a deeper understanding of mathematical concepts through guided, interactive problem-solving.
